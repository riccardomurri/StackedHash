StackedHash version 0.99
========================

The StackedHash module implements a stack of PERL hashes; the whole
stack acts collectively as a single hash, that is you can perform the
usual operations (fetching/storing values, *keys*, *delete*, etc.) on
it.

Assigning a value to a key, as in "$h{'a'}=1", puts the key/value pair
into the hash at the top of the stack. Reading a key off the stack of
hashes searches the whole stack, from the topmost hash to the bottom
one, until it finds a hash which holds some value associated to the
given key; returns "undef" if no match was found.

All the PERL bultins on hashes are supported.

Example code:

      use StackedHash;

      tie %h, StackedHash;

      $h{'a'}=1;
      $h{'b'}=2;
      tied(%h)->push; # put a new (empty) hash on the stack
      $h{'a'}=3;      # override value of key 'a'
        ...
      tied(%h)->pop;  # remove top hash from the stack,
                      # $h{'a'} == 1 again
